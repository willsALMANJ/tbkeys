    <p>tbkeys has been updated to version 2. Version 2 has the following important changes compared to version 1:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Version 2 is compatible with Thunderbird 78.</li>
    <li>The JSON config file is no longer used.</li>
    <li>Custom keybindings should be entered into the “Key bindings” field of tbkeys’ preferences which can be accessed from “Add-ons” in the Thunderbird menu (the exact sequence to get to the preferences is different in Thunderbird 68 and 78).</li>
    <li>If you previously used a JSON config file, its contents can be copied and pasted into this field.</li>
    </ul>
